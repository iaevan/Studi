# flex
Hmm an useless app 

It should be named Studying or somthing, but it's just the pre alpha stage ig

# What it does?
1. basically a stopwatch, counts your time
2. in every 10 minutes, its sends a notification to you to drink water
3. in every 30 minutes it sends you a notification to take a break. 
4. you can pause this thing, or you can reset.
5. the **coolest** thing is you can set this up on your discord game activity, this was the main reason behind making this shithole. 
> How to add icon in discord game activity? would love to have an icon there.
