# Studi
An app, basically a study timer, but has fun features.

# What it does?
1. basically a stopwatch, counts your time
2. in every 10 minutes, its sends a notification to you to drink water
3. in every 30 minutes it sends you a notification to take a break. 
4. you can pause this thing, or you can reset.
5. the **coolest** thing is you can set this up on your discord game activity, this was the main reason behind making this thing.
